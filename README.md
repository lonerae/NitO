## About

A social-deduction game for people gathered together in the same room.  
Use your detective skills and your role's special abilities to find out who are the ones spreading terror during the Nights -or be the one who spreads the terror.
With over 4 Factions competing for the City's dark Outskirts, use brain and muscles, cunning, bluff and rhetoric, to find yourself safe from the Square's noose and
the knifes of your Enemies. May your Faction be victorious in this strategic race -at least until the next Game begins.
